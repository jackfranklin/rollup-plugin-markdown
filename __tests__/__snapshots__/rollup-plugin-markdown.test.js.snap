"<p>It's fair to say that React 16.8 and the introduction of<br />
<a href=\\"https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\\">hooks</a> has really changed how we<br />
write React. Hooks are one of those APIs that make you realise the flaws of the<br />
previous approach <em>after</em> you stop using it. I remember being very skeptical of<br />
hooks when they were first released, not thinking that the previous class based<br />
design had many flaws, but I've since come to realise I was very wrong, and<br />
hooks are a vast improvement on how we build React components. If you're<br />
interested in comparing the old vs the new, I wrote a<br />
<a href=\\"/refactoring-to-react-hooks/\\">blog post refactoring a component to use hooks</a><br />
that offers a nice comparison.</p>"
